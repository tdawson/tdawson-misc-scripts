# tdawson-misc-scripts
various scripts I write as I am solving various problems

These are not the best scripts in the world, at all.
But they usually do their job.

I just need a place to put them because I end up scavaging part of them for other scripts.
Plus, if you want to see what I did, go for it.

NOTE: NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE - ANY OF THESE
THESE ARE FOR PROTOTYPING VARIOUS THINGS FAST
